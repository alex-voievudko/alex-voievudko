<h3>Frontend | Fullstack JavaScript Developer</h3>

<p>I have been working as a manager in game industry for the last 8 years but now I decided to change the direction of
my carrier.</p>
<p>Development always has been my passion and hobby for more than 5 years since I wrote the first script
for my team to automate their work. I have spent a lot of time learning JavaScript and React particularly and now I
am looking for new opportunities to turn my hobby into the real job</p>
